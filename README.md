# SPMeta2.Schema
SPMeta2.Schema is an experimental project to provide custom, user-defined model schema support for SPMeta2 models. In a nutshell, it enables easy conversion of SPMeta2 models from/to different formats such as XML/JSON/YAML.   
  
The built-in implementation provides support for model conversion into XML, JSON, and YAML as well as limited, experimental support for SharePointPnP models.
